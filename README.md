# PCA-on-MNIST
This notebook was developed for my internship at Analytics Vidhya as a part of the study material for their course on Applied Machine Learning in the Advanced Dimensionality Reduction module.

## What will we do?
 - Train a random forest classifier for digit label prediction on the original dataset
 - Transform the data using PCA
 - Train the same random forest classifier on the transformed data
 - Compare performance before and after PCA
 
### Surprise: Accuracy increases after Dimensionality Reduction!
